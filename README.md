## Prerequisites

Before running this project, make sure you have the following:

-   .NET Core SDK (Version 6) installed on your machine.
-   Stripe API public and secret keys.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

       git clone https://github.com/DavidVardzelian/Payment-Integration.git
    
 2. Navigate to the project folder:
	 

	    cd payment-project
2. Install the required dependencies:

		  }
		}

## How to Obtain Stripe API Keys

To use the Stripe API in this project, you need to sign up for a Stripe account at [https://stripe.com](https://stripe.com/). After signing up and logging in, you can find your API keys in the Dashboard under "Developers" > "API Keys".

**Important: Keep your API keys secure and do not share them publicly. The secret key should never be exposed in client-side code or checked into version control. Use environment variables or configuration files (like appsettings.json) to manage your API keys securely.**
